# Python RREF Solver

Solve systems of linear equations and matrices using the Python RREF Solver. This compact Python tool reduces matrices to row-echelon form, providing a straightforward solution for linear algebra problems. Simplify your matrix calculations with ease and precision.

## Features:

- **RREF Computation:** Quickly compute the Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF) of matrices.
  
- **Ease of Use:** A user-friendly tool for solving linear equations and working with matrices.

- **Efficient:** Streamlined functionality for hassle-free matrix manipulations.

## Getting Started:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GaGaNRaJ2003/RREF-Solver.git
   ```

2. **Run the Solver:**
   ```bash
   python rref.py
   ```

3. **Solve Linear Equations:**
   Input your matrices and let the Python RREF Solver do the heavy lifting.

You can Enhance the solver on your end if needed.
